       <li>Choose a programming language and learn the basics of its syntax: First, you have to pick the programming language that you’ll use to solve the programming questions found in HackerRank. There are plenty that you can start with, but I personally suggest that you start with C++, as it forces you to learn how the computer works and it makes transitioning to other programming languages much, much easier. Alternatively, Python is also a great place to start.</li>
       <li>
        Solve programming questions on your own: This is a crucial part of the learning process, especially if you’re just starting out with programming in general. Use a whiteboard before you try to code any algorithm to solve a problem, and don’t give up if you’re stumped on a programming problem. Solving questions on your own will improve your overall independence and proficiency as a programmer.
